Houston Texans Defensive Tackle, Vince Wilfork for ESPN ‘Body Issue’ cover shoot
At 325 pounds, Vince Wilfork isn’t the traditional guy that would pose nude for a magazine — even one that celebrates athletes. But as he points out in the ESPN Magazine Body Issue video, released on Thursday; he has NOTHING to be ashamed of — even if there might be some mean comments about the photos.
“I’m pretty sure there’s going to be some ‘oh he obese’ and ‘he’s this’ and woot the woot. Oh well. I’m PROUD of who I am…” he said. “I’m PROUD of my body. People can talk about me all they want. I don’t care. I NEVER lose sleep”

From my father making fun of me for being “chubby” when I was small to hating the way my thighs rubbed together when I walked, I hated entering public spaces. I used to do this thing where I’d tip-toe up the stairs, open the door really, really slowly then creep into the scene so that no one would see me. 
My anxiety stemmed from not wanting to be noticed. Why? In my head, there was nothing to see. I wasn’t special. I wasn’t cute or smart. I couldn’t fit into those tiny frayed denim shorts from Abercrombie like all the other girls. I was just a blob in men’s clothing because Mom ain’t have the money or resources to find clothes for her obese daughter. 
I was always obsessed with models on the catwalk and watched America’s Next Top Model religiously. I’d put on an old pair of heels and in my pajamas, I’d put my hands on my fat waist and strut. Click. Click. Click. The thick heels sounded on Mom’s wooden floor. I’d be on my own personal runway. Some sort of star. I’d go in the bathroom, shut the door, and look in the mirror. I’d work my angles just like Tyra suggested to the size 4 models. I’d smile and tilt my head and try to elongate my fat neck. Not knowing that one day this fat neck and thighs that still rub together would be sort of a big deal. 
I look at fear differently. It was all in my head. I was so afraid of what other people thought of my round body that I made myself sick. Now, there’s no fear when I step into a room. I burst in that bitch. I smile, arch my back, and strut, a party, Wal-Mart. My runway ain’t in Mom’s house anymore in a little girls head. My runway IS the entire world. 
Kind of iconic if you ask me 😜

I’m fucking over being the media’s and every fatphobe’s court jester. And it hurts saying that knowing the instance of the fat, disabled 6-year-old child in 1600s Spain who was publicly mocked and made into the equivalent of a court jester for the Spanish king who ordered his painter to paint the child’s nude body for us to ogle and laugh at centuries later. The painting was literally titled “The Monster Undressed,” and yet people want to yell at me, tell me I’m a liar, tell me I’m “ins*ne” for being upset that fat people are still The Monster in current day.But no matter how much you point and laugh at me for merely existing, I will never put on that makeup and juggle for you in the name of appeasement like I did before understanding my worth ever again. I have worth beyond that scale you try to chain me to, and that worth you can never destroy.
– Is based on paintings of a fat person literally just being a fat person called “the monster”– Is praised for being a good representation in every single wayHonestly I’m not surprised, at all. Just disgusted."

There’s not even any inclusion of “curvy Barbie” who is a mere size 10.In Barbie’s world, there are no fat people. Fat people don’t exist in her universe. And why would we? Barbie’s world is for the conventionally attractive, the fashionable, the ideal. Fat people regularly struggle even just to find clothes in real life. Why would Barbie’s universe include a fat ass like me?This movie just feels like a giant posterboard shoved in my face of who counts as worthy and acceptable in our society. And I know this post I’m writing won’t get anywhere. I know this will be drowned out by all of the adoration for Barbie and the movie, by all of the gifsets, by all of the jokes made in enjoyment of the film. I know that no one gives a shit about this. Because no one ever does. The amount of activism and advocacy that fat people receive in this world is abysmal since almost everyone alive still believes the way fat people are treated is just. That we get what we supposedly deserve for having the audacity to exist in the bodies we were given. I know that writing this post is absolutely fucking pointless. But if I don’t scream until the pain and injustices are heard, no one else will.This post is absolutely not pointless!!! :( I hear you and I see you!!! Fat Barbies deserve to exist and be represented!!! Honestly disappointed in this movie, but also not at all surprised. But best believe I will draw a fat Barbie for this post alone!!! 🩰 🎀 Thank you for caring and wanting to draw a fat Barbie for me c:> It hurts seeing all of the talk and love for this movie when it’s nothing but another painful reminder of how little fat people matter in society as anything other than a joke and a moneymaker for people who endorse our suffering.Nicola Coughlahan is in the movie though?Not that that’s enough of course, and I’m also saying this as a fellow  fat person. We shouldn’t have to settle for crumbs. I think we also need to wait because the movie sets up the  idea that the Barbie world IS problematic and needs to not have such  narrow standards of what is acceptable. How they’re gonna handle that is  up for question though…  I definitely hadn’t heard about that since absolutely none of the constant posts I’ve seen about the movie have included any fat actors. I looked at the IMDB page where they include all of the official posters and was surprised that two of the posters are of fat actresses. However, like you said, this is still crumbs, and there is a very good chance that the movie won’t address fatphobia at all. And out of all the official posters, there are two fat actresses…and 22 thin actors. I briefly looked at the rest of the cast who don’t have official posters and didn’t see any other fat actors listed. The likelihood that the two fat actresses will get much screentime, especially compared to—again—twenty two thin actors is as slim as the cast itself. I also want to point out that one of the two fat actresses, Nicola Coughlan, has explained over and over and over again that she wants nothing to do with fat liberation. She has been quoted and made tweets herself numerous times saying that she doesn’t want her weight to be important to anyone. She has directly said she isn’t a “body positive activist” (which I think is safe to say she doesn’t care about increasing positive fat representation in general since I doubt she knows much about fat activism beyond the watered down “body positivity” movement).She has explicitly stated that her body is a “tool” for her acting and that she will “lose or gain weight” according to what a role wants of her. If I’m remembering correctly, she has intentionally lost weight, which of course she has bodily autonomy but you can’t ignore the “why” of her choice to abuse her body into an unsustainable thinner form. She has explained that she doesn’t want any comments about her weight, period. That goes for negative or positive. There was one time some journalist called her body “fat” in a review of the play or whatever she had acted in and she went so far as to force the publication to get rid of the word from their article. And the way she described it, she didn’t make them do that because they had used the term in a mean way (I don’t even know if it WAS in a mean way) but because they used the term at all. She believes the word “fat” is always and every time derogatory.So is Nicola Coughlan good fat representation? Absolutely not. I know she doesn’t give a shit about her body adding diversity to the cast or giving fat people, the fat children who will watch the movie, representation. I know that she honestly probably wouldn’t have taken the role if it was clear from the script that the role was meant to add weight diversity and point out fatphobia in the Barbie toy line or society as a whole.It’s still possible that her character will help address fat people’s oppression and lack of representation, but I do not have my hopes up AT ALL knowing her. The one saving grace is that the other fat actress is Sharon Rooney, who I am so happy to see her be given a role in a big movie! She played the main character in My Mad Fat Diary, which was a show that did address fatphobia and eating disorders even if not perfectly (It’s hard for me to remember the specifics of what the show was like since I watched it years ago). She has also talked about wanting more representation of “normal people” in media, which she said includes fat people, but she’s still closer to watered down body positivity than actual fat liberation. Though she is of course 1000 times better than Nicola Coughlan and does care about fatphobia, even if not by name.However, like already mentioned, I sincerely doubt they will be in the movie much at all. I just watched the most recent trailer and, just like the other trailers I had already seen, they are no where in the video. Not even in the scenes of groups as large as 50 people. Not in any scenes with the Barbies that are implied to be the main characters either. Nothing. The only indications they are in the movie in any way are their names are written next to about 20 names of other cast members on a black screen near the end of the trailer, the movie is listed on the actresses’ IMDB pages, and they have an official poster you can hunt down. The only actual fat representation in any of the trailers I have managed to find is this background character on the very right of this scene that is shown for about three seconds:So yeah, even after learning that those two actresses are in the movie, I am a smidgen more hopeful but also understand that reality is that they’re probably at most going to be in the movie for five minutes and the lack of weight diversity in the toy line won’t actually be addressed.“She has explicitly stated that her body is a ""tool” for her acting and that she will “lose or gain weight” according to what a role wants of her.“ So she’s gonna ruin her body by crash dieting and then fatphobic culture is gonna say ""well look at her of course she has (insert thing here, statistically its heart disease that increases with yo yo dieting tho) shes fat!” Can actors just be allowed to act already and not abuse their bodies for casting calls?This is the exact quote where she says her body is a tool from this article:“Also, and I mean this in the nicest way possible, I’m not a body positivity activist,” she wrote. “I’m an actor I would lose or gain weight if an important role requirement. My body is the tool I use to tell stories, not what I define myself by.”  She wrote that on her now deleted Twitter account. From what I know of her, she seems to purposefully view acting in a vacuum and does not care about anything except being a “serious,” “respected” actress. She doesn’t care about representation, societal norms, or even the implication of her roles on how society views people with her identities. In the article I read that mentioned her forcing a publication to delete the word “fat” about her body, she had stated that her weight should have never been relevant since apparently the character’s weight in the book was never mentioned. And yet she didn’t stop to think about the reasons why when the book was made into a visual format, they specifically chose a fat actress to play a negative character. She only cared about being good at the role she was given. "
