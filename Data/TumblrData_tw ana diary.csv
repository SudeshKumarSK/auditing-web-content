By personal experience it helped a lot - ONLY FOR PLP WITH ED!)This once the winner must be me! It will be me! I’ll win this once not the food. Now i know the dangers behind food and i must avoid at all costs! Besides it’s just some hours of fast, just some minutes workout, stay to your program! The win is MINE!If you eat, you’ll regret, you’ll be sad and angry, disappointed of yourself. You’ll be judged by the people, about how much fat and gross you are and after all you’ll destroy everything, you won’t loose weight as quickly as you planned and once you eat you just can’t stop eating. Will you risk this? Will you eat? Will you throw it all away because of food? Will you really reach the point to be that much pathetic and allow food win? I think not. You aren’t even actually hungry you are only lazy Clear your mind. You don’t want to eat, you mustn’t eat! No meal deserves the shame after. Resisting is hard but better and less painful than regretting!Think of this alright, take a deep breath, close your eyes and imagine. You are skinny, you’ve reached your ugw, you are perfect ✨. When you go out people are staring at you, they are commenting over your body. Some girls looking at you wishing they were you. The ones that told you “you never gonna make it” and made fun of you, are finally seeing how much wrong they were for you. Everyone talking about how much pretty you are. Everyone is asking you if you are ok. Everyone pays attention to you and only. And it’s not just that, it’s many, many others the treasures of being skinny!But why? Why to only imagine such an amazing thing when you can make it come true by simply not eating? Can’t you see dear? You DESERVE to be beautiful! You must be beautiful! This is what you were born for! You deserve for once to be proud of yourself! So?…You still wanna eat?Let me know if it helped or if you want more content as such!"

Sorry for the clown who rb’ed this before. Here’s some things that help me to stop:💙Brush your teeth so your mouth feels clean💙If you have one, put your retainer or Invisalign in so you can’t eat💙Take small bites one at a time, chewing slowly or more than 25 times so you fill up quicker💙Sip some tea or water💙If you’re able, chug fat-free milk. Still some cals but it’ll fill you up for less than a binge💙Put the food out of your sight 💙Let yourself have some after completing a task. Such as “I can have x so long as I complete y first”💙Go for a walk if you’re able💙Take a nap"
