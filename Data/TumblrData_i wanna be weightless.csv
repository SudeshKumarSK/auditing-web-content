I got small 5 floral decorated bowls with gold painted trim for 5 dollars! They’re super elegant looking and using the small plates tricks my brain into thinking the portion is bigger, plus it motivates me to make my food look cute.Eat like a fairy! 🧚‍♀️ eggs, nuts, fruits, berries, veggies, tea, soup and water. Makes you look and feel elegant, plus they’re super healthy and good for you.Don’t cook, practice magic! (For those who follow those beliefs) Do research into different herbs and their meanings. For example, garlic is often used for protection, purification, and healing. Making a chicken broth and adding garlic with that intention not only adds nutrition to your food, but can help you manifest and improve your life. Making soup can seem boring, but thinking of it as a potion makes it a lot more appealing, plus adding herbs to infuse like Rosemary or Thyme make your soup tastier and don’t add calories. Make it cute! ❤️ I have a couple different shaped cookie cutters to help make my food cute. I love cutting my sandwiches, Pancakes, Tortillas and even fruit toppings into hearts, baby bottles, or flowers. Plus, it cuts a bit of calories away. Gives you a fun base to work on too.Toddler foooood. The apple sauce squeeze packs are perfect for making dots on smoothie bowls, pancakes, Oatmeal, you name it! Cereal snacks come in cute shapes and make great additions to low cal sorbet. Yogurt drops come in cute colors :) plus it’s all low cal and typically has extra nutrients. Get creative. Don’t cut out your favorite foods, just low-cal them! I love pancakes with syrup, but they are dangerous cause I could eat 10 million of them in one sitting. So instead, I make very tiny ones and cut them into hearts, and instead of syrup I use vanilla Greek yogurt. Stack them on top of one another, fill with blueberries and yogurt, and cut some Strawberries into hearts to put on top. Makes them look adorable, they’re much lower calorie, plus cultures for my tummy, and my pancake craving is satisfied. For pizza, I make caprese! Slice a fresh tomato, and slice thinly some Mozzarella cheese snackers. I use Belgiogioso cause it’s proportioned into 70 cals. Put a basil leaf on top and season with salt and pepper, and balsamic vinegar (optional). Satisfies the pizza craving and is infinitely healthier and lower cal than pizza.Stay safe loves ❤️ remember food is meant to nourish you, not punish you. Junk food will hurt you regardless of how much or little you eat it, healthy food will never hurt you. saving for later! "

How I lost weight Since this blog started gaining popularity (+700 followers in 4 days??? Thanks guys!!!) I’ve had a lot of people ask me how I lost weight. I think it’s time to make a list:•when you’re fasting never break a fast with high calorie food. Break with fat free low calorie options like fresh vegetables. The food you break a fast with is the most important food you eat.•if you have a day where you plan on eating more calories than usual (a cheat/binge day) spread the calories out over the course if the day. •drink lots of water in between bites of food. Makes you full faster.•if you want to loose your appetite fast chug water. Like, too much water. It’ll hurt your stomach a bit but it helps remove brings urges. Also if it’s inly water it won’t hurt you if you end up puking.•GUM!!! •green tea is a lifesaver but all other herbal teas work too. My favorite is one called buddas blend heaven can wait. It has so much flavour and 0 calories and it really helps satisfy binge cravings. I drink like 8 cups a day. Also a great antioxidant and has a lot of other health benefits.•if you’re craving tacos (I know I always am) take lettuce and put a tablespoon of zero fat sour cream on it and a tablespoon of salsa. It tricks you and reminds you enough of the food you’re craving. This works for other foods as well. Another one that works is mustard and ketchup on egg white or steamed mushroom to simulate a burger. Reminds you enough that the cravings go away.•BOUNCE! I bounce my legs all the time. Once you start it becomes a habit and it helps you burn calories. They really had up.•never weight yourself while you’re on your period. It’ll discourage you since bloating and water retention happens. You didn’t gain 2 pounds your body is just holding onto water.•sit ups before bed and after you wake up. In bed helps cause it keeps your spine from brusing especially after you loose weight •If you’re gonna eat something eat it 2 hours after you wake up. Eat it slowly with water/tea in between bites. •put extra shit in your backpack if you’re in school and carry it around with you. You’ll get used to it and it helps you burn a few extra calories. •take long routes everywhere. •any time you have a burst of energy go for a walk.•never fast for more than 3 days without at least some fresh veggies just for safety reasons.•I don’t suggest purging but if you’re going to, drink a bunch of milk before you do and then wait about 5 minutes. Makes it easier and won’t damage your teeth as much.•cardio!! DO YOUR CARDIO!!! TREADMILL!!!•listen to music or watch a show while you work out. It’ll help you some out and not realize how tired you are. •watch my 600lbs life while you’re on the treadmill. Trust me it’s motivation.•learn to like healthy food.  If you just talk about liking certain foods you can trick yourself into liking it. I honestly enjoy plain lettuce now.•eat crushed ice•CHEW. AND. SPIT. WHEN. YOU’RE. ALONE. I keep chocolate bars in my room and I chew up bites and spit them in the trash. Make sure you brush your teeth after and don’t swallow your spit. There’s  sugar and calories in that.

ITS OK TO EAT WHEN YOU NEED IT! But when you’re bored or just wanna eat to eat that’s when it’s not ok to eat. That 150 cal salad isn’t gonna make you gain it’s full of nutriants and if you feel like you’re gonna pass out trust me that salad or veggies or fruit what ever it is will help you feel better to keep going just try to find a healthy food or keep it under 200 cals. Even if you go over 500 cals ITS OK YOU WONT GAIN toddlers eat more than that it’s like ¼ of what your body needs just to function. If you eat more than most people here do that’s ok it’s not a compitition and your illness is still valid even tho you eat 800 cals or more daily.
