My heart rate has been higher and the HRV is super low from my fitbit report. I keep testing negative for covid I have no other symptoms just my chest hurts. Both my parents are now positive and I‚Äôve been around them without a mask. I ordered grocery pick up and added 3 covid tests with it so I can try to see if im positive or not before the celebration of life tomorrow. I‚Äôm really hoping I‚Äôm not having side effects from the oral minoxidil that I take. It has helped me a lot with regrowth of my hair. But the only alternative to the first two is that I‚Äôm having a heart attack. 
Tested negative again. So now I‚Äôm going to stop my minoxidil medication to see if that is cause my heart/chest problems. I‚Äôm also going to change my exercise plan to 3 days a week of lifting 2 days of cardio and 2 days of rest. Hopefully whatever this is stops soon."
